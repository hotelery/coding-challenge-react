# hotelery ReactJs coding challenge

Hello and welcome
glad you've made it here. This means that we consider you to welcome to our hotelery family.
One step to join the hotelery team as a React / Fronted develper is to solve this coding challenge.

You do not get extra credit for finishing challenge, the journey is the reward. Please stop at 30 minutes.

These are your todos. Good luck!

## Todos
1. In the file `src/App.tsx` you'll be finding a constant called `counter` and a `button`-element. Each click on the button should count up, starting at `5`, if the value reaches `10` it should be set to `0`. The counter must be accessable and settable **globally** / reusable in another component.
2. Write a value-transformer located in `src/helper/transform-priority.ts` to make the apropriate test-file succeed.
3. The command `npm run test` must not fail
